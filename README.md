# Pythonium

Pythonium is a space turn-based strategy game where each player leads an alien race that aims to conquer the galaxy.

You must explore planets to search and extract a valuable mineral: the `pythonium`.
This precious material allows you to build cargo and combat spaceships, or mines to get
more pythonium.

Manage the economy on your planets, and collect taxes on your people to finance your
constructions, but be careful! Keep your clans happy if you want to avoid unrest in your planets.

Put your space helmet on, set your virtualenv, and start coding.

Battle for pythonium is waiting for you!

## About the game

Pythonium is a [programming game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_game), which means you need to code a player to play.

You can choose by playing alone in single-player mode, in multi-player mode against some of the available bots, or your friend's bots.

The game generates several outputs that will help you to evaluate the performance of your player and make improvements on those.

## Acknowledge

This game is strongly inspired by [VGA Planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA_Planets), a space strategy war game from 1992 created by Tim Wisseman.

The modern version of VGA Planets is [Planets.nu](https://planets.nu/), and that project has also influenced the development of Pythonium.

To all of them, thank you.
